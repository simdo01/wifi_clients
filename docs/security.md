# Security Considerations

## Permissions and Access

### Root/Administrator Access
- Required for Nmap scanning
- Limit execution to trusted users
- Consider running as service with restricted permissions

### File Permissions
- Secure config.ini to prevent exposure of API keys
- Protect database file from unauthorized access
- Ensure log files are only readable by the application

## Network Security

### Scanning Scope
- Only scan networks you own or have permission to monitor
- Use appropriate CIDR ranges to limit scan scope
- Avoid scanning public or unauthorized networks

### Bandwidth Impact
- Default 5-minute scan interval balances detection vs load
- Adjust scan_interval based on network capacity
- Consider off-peak scanning for busy networks

## Data Protection

### API Credentials
- Secure Pushover API keys
- Never commit config.ini with real credentials
- Use environment variables in production

### Database Security
- SQLite database contains sensitive network information
- Implement proper file permissions
- Consider encryption for sensitive data
- Regular backups with secure storage

### Logging Security
- Logs may contain sensitive network information
- Implement log rotation to manage file sizes
- Secure access to log files
- Regular log cleanup

## Best Practices

1. Regular Updates
   - Keep Nmap updated
   - Update Python dependencies
   - Monitor security advisories

2. Access Control
   - Limit system access
   - Use secure passwords
   - Regular permission audits

3. Network Considerations
   - Monitor bandwidth usage
   - Respect privacy guidelines
   - Document scanning activities

4. Data Management
   - Regular database maintenance
   - Secure backup procedures
   - Data retention policies
